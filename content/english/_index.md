    title: "FIELD"
    director: "LÜ MEIJING"
    year: 2022
    description: "In a world shaped by networks, consumption, and technology, FIELD imagines new ways of being together. Through fragments of human and non-human connection—between people, animals, elements, and devices—the film creates a shifting space where perception and emotion resonate across consciousness. The result is a meditation on communication, community, and the fragile possibilities of co-existence."
