This information is gathered for all CATHAYPLAY visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using \"cookies.\" A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.

We collect this information so that we can provide you with the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.\n\nYou post your own private or personal information on the Website at your own risk.

Generally, you may opt out of such emails here, though CATHAYPLAY reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.\n\nCATHAYPLAY may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people are in a network like a band or a movie and personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you with CATHAYPLAY. We believe this benefits you. You can know more about the world around you and, where there are advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you. For example, if you put a favorite movie in your profile, we might serve you an advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar one in your town. But we don't tell the movie company who you are.\n\nWe may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to Social Network Platforms where we have a presence, newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Social Network Platform developers, and other users of CATHAYPLAY, to supplement your profile."
