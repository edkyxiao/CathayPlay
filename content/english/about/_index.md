    - "CathayPlay is a global streaming platform dedicated to independent Chinese-language cinema – a home for films that are bold, intimate, and rarely seen outside their local communities."
    - "Founded with a mission to preserve and promote the richness of Sinophone filmmaking, CathayPlay brings together voices from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and the wider Chinese-speaking diaspora, offering audiences around the world a deeper, more nuanced view of our contemporary realities."
    - "At the heart of CathayPlay is a belief that cinema should be a space for honesty and imagination. The platform curates documentaries, fiction features, experimental works, and short films that challenge dominant narratives and expand our understanding of Chinese-speaking worlds – its contradictions, hopes, anxieties, and transformations. Many of these films have screened at major festivals; many more have never had a platform at all. CathayPlay ensures they can be seen, discussed, and remembered."
